        <h1>VR Sleep Simulator</h1>
        <h3>Sleep paralysis is a condition identified by a brief loss of muscle control, known as atonia,that happens just after falling asleep or waking up. In addition to atonia, people often have hallucinations during episodes of sleep paralysis.
            Researchers believe that about 8% of people experience sleep paralysis at some point in their life. Since so many people have experienced it, we think itâ€™s important to spread awareness.
            When wearing the VR-glasses you can look around and have a similar experience to the sleep paralysis.</h3>
